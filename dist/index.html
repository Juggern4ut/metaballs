      <p>
        This is a simple project that generates Metaballs. If the balls are
        clicked, they will split into two smaller metaballs.

        Metaballs are mathematical models used to create the appearance of a
        liquid or blob-like object. They are commonly used in computer graphics
        to simulate organic or fluid-like shapes. The way metaballs work is by
        defining a surface that changes based on the proximity of several
        defined objects, called control points. The resulting surface is smooth
        and can have a variety of shapes, depending on the position and number
        of control points.
      </p>
      <p>
        In summary, metaballs are a useful tool for creating smooth, flowing
        shapes in computer graphics and are often used to simulate fluid-like
        objects.

        Their appearance is reminiscent of the old lava lamps from the 1970s.
